# Custom Enchantment 3 Plugin Loot Item

Contains the default loot item configuration of the plugin

### Installation

For smoother update, you'll need to turn off your server to save everything that is running. Doing `/reload` is fine since this plugin supports the command but if you have multiple plugins installed in your server, it's better to turn the server off.

Download a copy of [LootItems.yml](/loot_items/default/LootItems.yml) and replace your existing file inside the plugin's folder.

Once set, you can now start your server.

### Contribution

You can customize your own [LootItems.yml](/loot_items/default/LootItems.yml) by submitting your own copy of it for others to use.
