# Custom Enchantment 3 Plugin Language

Contains the default configuration of the plugin

### Installation

For smoother update, you'll need to turn off your server to save everything that is running. Doing `/reload` is fine since this plugin supports the command but if you have multiple plugins installed in your server, it's better to turn the server off.

Download a copy of [lang.yml](/languages/english/lang.yml) and replace your existing file inside the plugin's folder.

Once set, you can now start your server.

### Contribution

The default [lang.yml](/languages/english/lang.yml) translation is `English` but you can submit your own copy translated on your own language.

#### Steps for contribution:

- Fork this repository
- make a folder of your own [lang.yml](/languages/english/lang.yml) and place at this location `language/[LANG]-[plugin-version]/`.
- Do a `Pull Request` and add [JayMar921](https://github.com/jaymar921) as reviewer (this make sure that I'll get notified)
