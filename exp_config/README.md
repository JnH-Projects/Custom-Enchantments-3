# Custom Enchantment 3 Plugin Exp Configuration

Contains the default experience configuration of the plugin

### Installation

For smoother update, you'll need to turn off your server to save everything that is running. Doing `/reload` is fine since this plugin supports the command but if you have multiple plugins installed in your server, it's better to turn the server off.

Download a copy of [ExpConfig.yml](/exp_config/default/ExpConfig.yml) and replace your existing file inside the plugin's folder.

Once set, you can now start your server.

### Contribution

If you feel that the default [ExpConfig.yml](/exp_config/default/ExpConfig.yml) is too OP or unbalanced, you can provide submit your own copy of the `ExpConfig.yml`
