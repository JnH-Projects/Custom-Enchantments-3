# Custom Enchantment 3 Plugin Looting Plot

Contains the default looting plot configuration of the plugin

### Installation

For smoother update, you'll need to turn off your server to save everything that is running. Doing `/reload` is fine since this plugin supports the command but if you have multiple plugins installed in your server, it's better to turn the server off.

Download a copy of [LootPlots.yml](/looting_plots/default/LootPlots.yml) and replace your existing file inside the plugin's folder.

Once set, you can now start your server.

### Contribution

You can customize your own [LootPlots.yml](/looting_plots/default/LootPlots.yml) by submitting your own copy of it for others to use.
