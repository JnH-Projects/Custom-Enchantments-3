# Custom Enchantment 3 Plugin Configuration

Contains the default configuration of the plugin

### Installation

For smoother update, you'll need to turn off your server to save everything that is running. Doing `/reload` is fine since this plugin supports the command but if you have multiple plugins installed in your server, it's better to turn the server off.

Download a copy of [config.yml](/config/default/config.yml) and replace your existing file inside the plugin's folder.

Once set, you can now start your server.

### Contribution

If you feel that the default [config.yml](/config/default/config.yml) is too OP or unbalanced, you can provide submit your own copy of the `config.yml`

#### Steps for contribution:

- Fork this repository
- copy the default [config.yml](/config/default/config.yml) and place at this location `config/[title]-[plugin-version]/`
- Do a `Pull Request` and add [JayMar921](https://github.com/jaymar921) as reviewer (this make sure that I'll get notified)
